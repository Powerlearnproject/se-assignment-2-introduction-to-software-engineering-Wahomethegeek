# SE-Assignment-2
Assignment: Introduction to Software Engineering
Instructions:
Answer the following questions based on your understanding of software engineering concepts. Provide detailed explanations and examples where appropriate.

Questions:
Define Software Engineering:

    This is a branch of computer science that deals with the  design, development, testing, and maintenance of software  applications.

What is software engineering, and how does it differ from traditional programming?
Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC):

    In Software engineering process, most effort goes into  buildig new designs and features. 
     Whereas in SDLC development may be a less structured process that involves  writing , testing and deploying the software.


Explain the various phases of the Software Development Life Cycle. Provide a brief description of each phase.
Agile vs. Waterfall Models:

 According to [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/what-is/sdlc/#:~:text=The%20software%20development%20lifecycle%20(SDLC,expectations%20during%20production%20and%20beyond.) this are the different stages of life cycle

### Plan
* This phase include tasks like cost benefit analysis and resource estimation.

### Design
* Software engineers analyze requirements and identify the best solutions to the software

### Implement

* The development team codes the product. They analyze the requirements to identify smaller coding tasks.

### Deploy

* When teams develop software, the code and test on a different copy of the software than the one they have access to.

### Maintain
* In this phase, among other tasks, the team fixes bugs, resolve customer issues and manages the software

[Agile] [Model](https://www.javatpoint.com/software-engineering-agile-model) This development approach is based on iterative development. It breaks tasks into smaller iterations , do not directly involve long term planning.

[Waterfall] [Model](https://www.javatpoint.com/software-engineering-waterfall-model) This model has five phases: Requirements analysis and specification, design, implementation, and unit testing, integration and system testing, and operation and maintenance. The steps always follow in this order and do not overlap




Compare and contrast the Agile and Waterfall models of software development. What are the key differences, and in what scenarios might each be preferred?
Requirements Engineering:

What is requirements engineering? Describe the process and its importance in the software development lifecycle.
Software Design Principles:

Explain the concept of modularity in software design. How does it improve maintainability and scalability of software systems?
Testing in Software Engineering:

Describe the different levels of software testing (unit testing, integration testing, system testing, acceptance testing). Why is testing crucial in software development?
Version Control Systems:

What are version control systems, and why are they important in software development? Give examples of popular version control systems and their features.
Software Project Management:

Discuss the role of a software project manager. What are some key responsibilities and challenges faced in managing software projects?
Software Maintenance:

Define software maintenance and explain the different types of maintenance activities. Why is maintenance an essential part of the software lifecycle?
Ethical Considerations in Software Engineering:

What are some ethical issues that software engineers might face? How can software engineers ensure they adhere to ethical standards in their work?
Submission Guidelines:
Your answers should be well-structured, concise, and to the point.
Provide real-world examples or case studies wherever possible.
Cite any references or sources you use in your answers.
Submit your completed assignment by [due date].
